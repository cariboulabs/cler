--------------EaslyLink--------------

Easylink is a lightweight wireless communication API developed by Texas Instruments (TI). 
It’s part of the SimpleLink™ software framework for TI’s Sub-1 GHz and 2.4 GHz radios,
like the CC1101, CC1310, CC1350, and similar devices.
Easylink’s purpose is to make low-power, narrowband, 
point-to-point or star networks simple to implement without the overhead of complex wireless stacks. .
